# The Nth Element Of Two Sorted Arrays
Use binary search to find the nth element of two sorted Arrays in O (log n).

A [1...n] and B [1...n] be two arrays of distinct integers, each sorted in an increasing order. Find the nth smallest of the 2n combined elements. The program run in O (log n) time.

The development environment is Visual Studio. The programming language is C++. In order to solve this problem in O (log n), I try to use binary search, because A [1...n] and B [1...n] are both sorted in an increasing order.
